## Frontend Setup Instructions
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the 'app' folder in your terminal:
   ```
    cd app
    ```
2. Run the following command to install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install --force
    ```
3. Once installation is complete, start the application by running:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

The app will launch in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Any changes you make will trigger an automatic reload, and any errors will be displayed in the console.
