# Welcome to CrowdWave

## Overview

CrowdWave is a digital crowdfunding platform designed to facilitate connections between college-based startups and their backers. Our platform not only serves as a conduit for funding but also raises awareness about the crowdfunding ecosystem, empowering college entrepreneurs to register for crowdfunding, gather public feedback, and extend their reach.
